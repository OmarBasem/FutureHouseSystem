- First open a command prompt as administrator

1. Create a virtual env & activate it
> python3 -m venv env
> .\env\Scripts\activate

2. Install the backend python packages using pip
> py -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt

3. go to src folder
> cd src

4. run server
> python manage.py runserver

5. open a new command prompt window and navigate to the src folder then go to frontend folder inside src
and run the following command to install the frontend react packages:
> npm install

6. activate webpack server to listen for changes in react code
> .\node_modules\.bin\webpack --config webpack.config.js --watch

Go to the local host (ip address given when you run the django server) in your browser and should see a white home page. Test connection to the backend server from there.

Also, you can go the admin page through: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
username: admin
Password: heriotwatt

In the admin page you can see all the database tables, create new objects, update them or delete them.
